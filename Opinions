Vendula:
1) Should it be 9 repeats per treatment? Two operators measured same run -> average
3) Is it necesary to display boxplot of L and m when we set values of both variables?
  Are we sure with the run_order?
4)

Sabina:
5) there should be Tukey test for significant difference in means between different levels of  𝐿, 𝑚 and angle, but there is test only for angle
10) is the model 'period ~ sqrt_L + angle_c' really our best model?
